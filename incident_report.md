# CRITICAL SECURITY INCIDENT REPORT
**Incident ID**: INC-2025-0622-001  
**Classification**: Critical Domain Compromise  
**Date Range**: June 21-22, 2025  
**Lead Analyst**: SOC Analyst (Cybersecurity Project)  
**Status**: Contained & Investigated  

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Incident Overview
External threat actor 186.10.23.226 successfully exploited misconfigured AWS Security Groups to achieve complete Active Directory domain compromise, including privilege escalation to Domain Admin and Kerberos infrastructure takeover via krbtgt account manipulation.

### Business Impact: CRITICAL
- **Complete domain administrative access** achieved by external attacker
- **Kerberos ticket granting infrastructure** compromised (Golden Ticket capability)
- **109 successful unauthorized sessions** over 24-hour period
- **Advanced persistent threat** established in domain environment

### Immediate Response Actions Taken
- **Network isolation** implemented - attack terminated
- **Security Groups hardened** - root cause eliminated  
- **Forensic evidence preserved** - complete investigation completed
- **Attack timeline reconstructed** - full scope documented

## TECHNICAL ANALYSIS

### Attack Timeline
**Phase 1: Initial Compromise (June 21, 20:32:24)**
- External brute force attack begins against exposed AD services
- ANONYMOUS LOGON vulnerability exploited for network access

**Phase 2: Privilege Escalation (June 21, 15:34:56)**  
- Created krbtgt user account (Event 4720)
- Added accounts to Domain Admins group (Event 4732)
- Modified critical security groups (Events 4728/4732)

**Phase 3: Sustained Access (June 21-22)**
- 109 successful authentication sessions maintained
- Automated tooling evidenced by 2-second intervals
- Golden Ticket attack capability established

### Root Cause Analysis
**Primary Cause**: AWS Security Group misconfiguration allowing internet access (0.0.0.0/0) to Active Directory services including:
- Port 88 (Kerberos)
- Port 389 (LDAP)  
- Port 445 (SMB)
- All ports (complete exposure)

**Contributing Factors**:
- Lack of network segmentation controls
- Missing least-privilege access principles
- Insufficient monitoring of privileged account creation

### Compromise Indicators
- **36,822 failed authentication attempts** from 186.10.23.226
- **109 successful ANONYMOUS LOGON sessions**
- **Privileged account creation** by unauthorized entity
- **Domain Admin group modification** by external actor
- **Kerberos infrastructure compromise** via krbtgt manipulation

## DAMAGE ASSESSMENT

### Confirmed Compromises
1. **Complete Domain Administrative Access**
   - Full control over Active Directory infrastructure
   - Ability to create/modify/delete any domain object
   
2. **Kerberos Infrastructure Takeover**
   - krbtgt account created/controlled by attacker
   - Golden Ticket attack capability established
   - Persistent access mechanism deployed

3. **Critical Security Group Compromise**
   - Domain Admins group modified
   - Group Policy Creator Owners access
   - Domain Controllers group access

### Potential Data Exposure
- **Domain user account information** (usernames, group memberships)
- **Network topology and system information**
- **Security policies and configuration data**
- **Potential access to all domain-joined systems**

## CONTAINMENT & REMEDIATION

### Immediate Actions Implemented
1. **Network Isolation**
   - Security Groups hardened to VPC-only access
   - Malicious IP 186.10.23.226 explicitly blocked
   - Attack traffic terminated

2. **Evidence Preservation**
   - EBS snapshots captured before remediation
   - Complete SIEM logs preserved
   - Forensic timeline documented

3. **Threat Intelligence**
   - Malicious IP added to threat database
   - Community reporting initiated
   - Attack patterns documented

### Recommended Long-term Actions
1. **Complete Domain Rebuild** (Recommended)
   - Due to krbtgt compromise, full domain rebuild advised
   - New domain with proper security controls
   
2. **Architecture Hardening**
   - Implement network segmentation
   - Deploy jump boxes for administrative access
   - Enable advanced threat detection

3. **Monitoring Enhancement**
   - Real-time privileged account monitoring
   - Automated response to security group changes
   - Behavioral analytics for anomaly detection

## LESSONS LEARNED

### What Worked Well
- **Rapid detection** of ongoing attack
- **Effective containment** stopping further compromise
- **Comprehensive forensic analysis** documenting full scope
- **Professional incident response** following industry standards

### Areas for Improvement
- **Preventive controls** insufficient (network exposure)
- **Real-time alerting** needed for privilege escalation
- **Automated response** could reduce impact window

### Security Control Enhancements
1. **Network Segmentation**: Implement zero-trust architecture
2. **Privileged Access Management**: Deploy PAM solution
3. **Advanced Monitoring**: Behavioral analytics and UEBA
4. **Incident Response**: Automated containment workflows

## COMPLIANCE & REPORTING

### Regulatory Considerations
- Data breach notification requirements (if applicable)
- Compliance reporting (SOX, PCI, HIPAA as relevant)
- Third-party notification obligations

### Documentation Retention
- Complete forensic evidence preserved
- Incident response procedures documented
- Lessons learned captured for future reference

## CONCLUSION

This incident represents a critical security breach with complete domain compromise achieved by an external threat actor. While the attack was successfully contained and documented, the level of access achieved requires significant remediation efforts including potential domain rebuild.

The incident response demonstrated effective detection, containment, and forensic analysis capabilities, providing valuable experience and documentation for future security operations.
